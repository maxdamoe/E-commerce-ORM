# E-commerce-ORM

This is my E-Commerce Back-end project. It runs using Express.js, Node.js, mysql DB, mysql2, Sequelize, and utilizes dotenv. The project is a functional backend for an e-commerce shopping experience, allowing for the accurate recording and retrieval of important product information and customer data.
